Listening. Task 1. MUSEUM OF THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE
The building of the museum of the History of Science was built in 1683.

The building originally contained a chemical laboratory in the basement, and lecture space for Experimental Natural Philosophy, what we today might call science.

The showcases on either side of the exit contain the kind of things that we used in this room in the 18th century.

The museum of the History of Science opened in 1926.

The museum is particularly famous for its collection of early scientific instruments.

In the four corners of the entrance gallery, there are four of the museum’s important individual collections.

Variant 1: Writing Task (Updated)
Studying abroad, I would miss my hometown’s cozy streets, especially the old park where I used to walk with friends. I’d also miss speaking my native language every day—it’s more than just words; it’s a connection to my culture. Most of all, I’d miss our family traditions, like holiday meals and celebrations that bring everyone together. These small things make home special, and being far away would remind me how much they mean to me. Still, new experiences await, and I hope to share my culture while learning about another.

Variant 2: Writing Task (Updated)
My university stands out for three reasons. First, its historic library has a unique collection that inspires learning. Second, the professors are not just teachers but mentors who encourage curiosity. Finally, the campus culture is vibrant, with events like international festivals that unite students from different backgrounds. These elements create an environment where education goes beyond lectures, making every day meaningful. I’m proud to be part of such a dynamic community.
